## Python Object Oriented Programming

Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming styles, including object-oriented programming ( OOP ) through the use of **objects** and **classes**.

An object is any entity that has **attributes** and **behaviors**. For example, a `parrot` is an object. It has

- **attributes** - name, age, color, etc.

- **behavior** - dancing, singing, etc.

Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.
