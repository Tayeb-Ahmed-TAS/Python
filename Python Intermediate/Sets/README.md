## Sets

### Compbine Sets:

- Sets can be combined using mathematical operations.

- The **union** operator | combines two sets to form a new one containing items in either.

- The **intersection** operator & gets items only in both.

- The **difference** operator - gets items in the first set but not in the second.

- The **symmetric difference** operator ^ gets items in either set, but not both.

- Example:

        first = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

        second = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

        print(first | second)

        print(first & second)

        print(first - second)

        print(second - first)

        print(first ^ second)
