## Tuples

### Tuple Unpacking

- Tuple unpacking allows you to assign each item in a collection to a variable.

- Example: 

        numbers = (1, 2, 3)

        a, b, c = numbers

        print(a)

        print(b)
        
        print(c)

- This can be also used to swap variables by doing a, b = b, a , since b, a on the right hand side forms the tuple (b, a) which is then unpacked.
