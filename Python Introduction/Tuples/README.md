## Tuples

- Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).

- Also, they are created using  **parentheses ( )**, rather than square brackets.

- You can access the values in the tuple with their index.

- Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes an error.

- Tuples can be created without the parentheses by just separating the values with commas.

- Example: 

        my_tuple = "one", "two", "three"
