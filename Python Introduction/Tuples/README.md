## Tuples

- Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).

- Also, they are created using ** parentheses ( ) **, rather than square brackets.

- You can access the values in the tuple with their index.

- Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes an error.
