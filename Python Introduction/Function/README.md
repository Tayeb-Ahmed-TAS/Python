## Function

#### What is Function ?

- A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

- Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks.

- As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

#### Error

- The function needs to be defined before it can be called. Calling a function before its definition will cause an error.

#### Arguments

- Functions can take arguments, which can be used to generate the function output.

- You can call the same function with different arguments.

- Even better, you can define functions with more than one argument; separate them with commas.

- Arguments can be used as variables inside the function.

- You can have different statements in your functions, working with the argument variables, such as if statements and loops.

#### Returning from Functions

- Once you return a value from a function, it immediately stops being executed.

- Any code placed after the return statement wonâ€™t be executed.

- A function can only return once, thus, if you need to return multiple values, you can use a list.
